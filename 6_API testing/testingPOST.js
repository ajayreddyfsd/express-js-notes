//   and turns it into a JavaScript object on req.body.
// - Without this line, req.body will be undefined for JSON POSTs.

// - If you try GET /submit, it will NOT match (and youâ€™ll likely see 404).

  //! Send a response back to the client to confirm we got the data.
  // - status(200) means "OK" (request succeeded).
  // - .json(...) sends a JSON response.
  // - We echo back the data they sent so they can see it came through.
