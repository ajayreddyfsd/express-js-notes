## üìù Project Notes: Full-Stack React & Node.js üöÄ

### Project Structure & Setup
- The project is organized into **three main parts**: a `client` folder for the front end, a `server` folder for the back end, and the **root project folder** that contains both.
- **Each of these three folders has its own `package.json` file**.
- We'll eventually tweak the **root** `package.json` to run both the front end and back end simultaneously with a **single command**. To do this, we need to install the `concurrently` package.

---

### Front-End (Client)
- The `client` folder is just a standard React project.
- To run **just the front end**:
    1. `cd` into the `client` folder.
    2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    3. Run `npm start` to start the project.

---

### Back-End (Server)
- The `server` folder is a standard Express MVC (Model-View-Controller) project.
- To run **just the back end**:
    1. `cd` into the `server` folder.
    2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    3. Run `node server.js` to start the server.
    4. only to install dependenciess, we are cd-ing in to server, but just to run the backend, u need not cd, just run the server.js file in the server-folder

---

### Core Back-End Development
- Before you begin, navigate to the `server` folder.
- You'll need to install the following packages: `express`, `nodemon`, and `cors`.
- The main file for the back end is `server.js`. You'll run this specific file to start the server.
- Also, don't forget to set your MongoDB connection string in the `services/mongo.js` file:
    ```javascript
    const MONGO_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017/";
    ```

---

### The `models` Folder (The 'M' of MVC)
- This folder is where all the **data- and database-related logic** lives.
- We created schemas for the `planetsCollection` and `launchesCollection`.
- In `planets.model.js`, we read a `.csv` file as a stream, filtered the planets, and stored them in the `planetsCollection`.
- In `launches.model.js`, we used `axios` to get data from an external API and saved each launch document to the `launchesCollection`.
- we are literally storing theses i the local mongodb database, since we havent named the database anything, it might name it as "test"
- We also implemented two key functions here:
    - `scheduleNewLaunch()`: adds a new launch document to the collection.
    - `abortLaunchById()`: instead of deleting a launch document, this function adds new key-value pairs to it, marking it as aborted.

---

### The `services` Folder
0. has 2 files, mongo.js and query,js
1. Handles MongoDB connection and disconnection, including acknowledging successful connections and errors.
2. Contains code to facilitate **pagination**.
3. This is where you need to provide the MongoDB connection string.

---

### The `routes` Folder (The 'C' of MVC)
- This is where we handle **API endpoints** and all `GET` and `POST` requests.
- The `routes` folder is essentially the **controllers folder**.
- Each API endpoint is typically made up of two files: a **controller file** and a **router file**.
    - The **controller file** contains the core controller functions.
    - The **router file** maps specific routes to these controller functions.
- Controllers and routers work together: the controller functions return data (like JSON, text, or HTML), and the router files organize these controller-functions by mapping them to specific routes. We usually have multiple controller-files and router-files.
- Finally, in `app.js`, we "mount" these routers on specific-paths again so the server knows which router to use for which request.
-but here in the code, what we will do is, we will make a helper to do this, api.js, and then use the api.js in app.js

---

### The `api.js` File (An `app.js` Helper)
- Remember how we import all the controller-based router files and define their routes again in app.js? We do that in `api.js`. This file acts as a central helper for `app.js`.

---

### The `app.js` File
- This file imports all necessary packages and sets up middleware.
- **Two important middleware packages are `cors` and `morgan`**:
    - `cors` is essential because our front end and back end run on different servers.
    - `morgan` is great for logging every request to the console.
- So, `app.js` is mainly for importing dependencies, setting up middleware, and including the `api.js` helper file. It also defines one last route to catch all the other possible routes.

---

### The `server.js` File
- **This is the file we run to start the server.**
- It contains the `startServer()` function.
- Anything you want to execute immediately after the server starts, like connecting to the database, should be placed inside this `startServer()` function.

---

### Running Front & Back End Together
- **Step 1:** Check the port the back-end is running on (from `server.js`) and the path it's mounted on (from `app.js`).
    - In our case, the back end is on port `8000` and is mounted on the `/v1` path.
    - This means your API URL is `http://localhost:8000/v1`. You can test this URL in Postman to make sure everything is working.
- **Step 2:** Use this exact URL as the API URL in your front-end code, specifically in `utils/requests.js`.
- **Step 3:**
    1. First, run the back end by running `node server.js`.
    2. Then, `cd` into the `client` folder and run `npm start` to run the front end.

---

### Running Both With a Single Command
- To simplify the process, you can use `concurrently`.
- In the **root** `package.json` file, add the following script:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "watch": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
    }
    ```
- Next, install `concurrently` as a development dependency:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev concurrently
    ```
- Now, you can run both the front end and back end with a single command:
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```

---

### Connecting to the Database
- All the database-related code is located in the `models` folder.
- Make sure MongoDB is running on your computer and open mongodb compass.
- Place the correct connection string in the `mongo.js` file in the back-end services folder.
